# US-HOME-PRICE-PREDICTION

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting home prices in the United States over a span of two decades. The goal is to develop accurate predictive models to forecast housing prices based on various influencing factors.

### Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project contains comprehensive information related to US home prices spanning the last two decades. It includes a diverse set of features such as economic indicators, demographic data, mortgage rates, and housing market statistics.

### Project Structure

Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis and modeling.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation.
Models: Saved trained models for home price prediction.
Results: Summary of model evaluation metrics and insights derived from the analysis.
Visualizations: Visual representations of data exploration, feature importance, and model performance.

### Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset, visualizing trends, and identifying correlations between features and home prices.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for modeling.
Modeling Techniques: Employing various regression models including Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regularization, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor.
Model Evaluation: Assessing models based on evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Adjusted R-squared.
Feature Importance: Utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for understanding the impact of different features on home prices.

### Results and Conclusion
Best Performing Model: Identified Lasso Regularization as the most accurate model for predicting US home prices.
Insights: Uncovered influential factors affecting home prices and highlighted features with minimal impact.
Future Directions: Recommendations for further improvements, feature engineering, or alternative modeling approaches.
